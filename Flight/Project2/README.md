# Project 2
This project is almost the same as the last one however this one does it with dronekit, which is the python library we will hopefully be using moving forward.

## Useful Commands
Reference [DroneKit-python's](https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/tree/master/examples) examples for how to pilot and move the drone.

## Testing
The simulator for testing should be automatically booted and ran in the code if not ensure the setup for drone kit is correct.

## Extra Information
MAVSDK is being swapped for dronekit in our code this year due to troubles with the firmware (PX4), so we are instead switching to dronekit-python because it works on a more supported firmware ArduPilot.

[Flight Docs](https://missourimrr.github.io/docs/flight/) has some useful information to reference with asyncio and process to using the drone.

[DroneKit](https://github.com/dronekit) has information about the python library and the simulator, so reference it and its examples when needing help.
